### Proteomics Mass Spectrometry based Data Analysis 

Welcome to the repository for my Master Thesis in Biomedical Data Science. This repository hosts the code, tools, and data analysis performed as part of my thesis work. The project focuses on the analysis of MS proteomic data from various studies.

## Contents

- **Python Modules**: Custom mdules developed to assist with data analysis.
- **Data Analysis Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook with detailed data analysis of the datasets listed below.

## Datasets

The following datasets were analyzed in this project:

| Study | Type | Method* |
|-------|-------|----------|
| [Iwata, H., et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12849) | Bulk | DDA      |
| [Li, P., et al. (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B2100930) | Bulk | DDA      |
| [Li, P., et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34267761/) | Bulk | DDA      |
| [Huffman, R. G., et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01830-1) | Single Cell | DIA      |

**Method: DDA (Data-Dependent Acquisition) or DIA (Data-Independent Acquisition)*

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/src**: Contains custom Python tools and modules developed for data analysis.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks with the data analysis and visualizations.
- **/data**: Processed data files used in the analysis (not included due to size; see below for details on accessing raw data).


## Usage

To use the tools and run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/powwowath/pyMSpro.git
    cd pyMSpro
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the analysis**:
    Open the Notebook "00_workflow_META-ANALYSIS.ipynb" and follow the instructions to perform the analysis.
